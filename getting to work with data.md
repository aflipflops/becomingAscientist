The first things that I learnt after starting my PhD was the programming language called `R`. I recall somewhat clearly two phases - the first one, spanning weeks, where I read a few important books on the subject and practiced hands-on using tutorials and the second one (which continues to date), where I am learning on the fly as the projects demand it (I just finished writing my first paper). This second one will perhaps continue lifelong. 

I primarily used the three links below to start learning about R, data-wrangling (quite an apt word), plotting and analysing data.

* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) - In the author's words "Youâ€™ll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it".  This book is pure gold, it's literally one of the best-written technical-instructional books I have read. Inititally read chapters 1-21
* [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/) - Making plots based on the ggplot2 package
* [Cookbook for R ](http://www.cookbook-r.com/)

As you will get into the routine of R, you will need to know which functions to use and how to use them. The features within 'R-Studio' will help you know "how to use a function?" (also mentioned in the book- *R for Data Science* ) but cheatsheets help you with "which function to use and when?"
Stick these cheatsheets somewhere on your desk[^1]
* [Strings cheat sheet- `stringr`](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/strings.pdf)
* [Data Import Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf)
* [Data Transformation Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf)
* [Data Visualization Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)
* [Base R cheat sheet](http://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/base-r.pdf)

After a few months into R you will be solving your data-related problems using a mixture of i) finding solutions on stackExchange (the most often), ii) Using `?<whatever-you-want-to-look-up> or ??<...>` but unfortunately not enough often asking the people around you with more experience. Each one of these are useful but the advantage of iii) is that you will also get personalised replies and when they come to work on your computer or you go to theirs - you can see their workflow! This always helped me. What shortcuts are they using, how are they thinking, how are they tackling the problem etc.

When you start with an "actual project", meaning "start scrolling down", you will need to start using *R Markdown*. Ending with `.Rmd`, these files can be created using RStudio and allow you to combine text, code and comments. Read chapter 22 in "R for Data Science" and download the cheatsheet [here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf).
